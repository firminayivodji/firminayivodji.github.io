  <li> <b>Identification and Estimation of Common Factors in Panel Data</b> (JMP) [Draft coming soon]</li> 
         <p align="justify">This paper examines the estimation of relations among factors extracted from different panel data sets. 
           Two interesting applications are the factors contributing to economic growth and the synchronicity of business cycles. 
            We show that the estimation of factors induces a bias in the estimated correlation between factors which disappears 
           if the factors are estimated from panel data sets that contain a large number of cross-sectional series. 
           We show that a modified version of the wild bootstrap algorithm proposed by Gonçalves and Perron (2014) 
           can correct the bias and provide reliable inference on the correlation of interest. Finally, we apply our modified bootstrap method 
           to the contributions of institutional factors to economic growth analyzed in Deniz et al. (2018) and to the degree of synchronization
           of business cycles among developed countries and emerging economies in Kose et al. (2013) and Aastveit et al. (2015).</p>

        <li> <b>Regional and Sectoral News-Based Indicators for Macroeconomic Forecasting</b> </li> 
         <p align="justify">
           This paper evaluates the informational content of sentiment extracted from news articles about the state of the economy. 
           First, we apply deep learning and lexical-based techniques to construct a new high-frequency measure of sentiment indices embodied in a vast news corpus covering economic 
           and financial articles in Canada from January 1977 to March 2022. These sentiment indices are constructed at the sectoral, provincial, and national levels. Second, we document that the sentiment indices significantly correlate with contemporaneous
           key economic and financial variables such as GDP, inflation, housing prices, and unemployment. 
           Third, we use an advanced machine learning method to isolate information about future, current, and past sentiments. 
           Finally, this paper provides novel evidence of how news sentiment tracks current economic and financial conditions and significantly 
           enhances predictive power in forecasting models using shrinkage methods and non-linear machine learning techniques.</p>

 <li> <b>The Power of Text: How Media Narratives Influence Canadian Regional Housing Markets</b> </li> 
 <p align="justify"> Housing price prediction is a big challenge. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) showed that even the most sophisticated traditional
 macro-financial models failed to foresee the crisis. 
 In this paper, we investigate whether information from Canadian local newspaper articles about housing market narratives could improve
 local housing price predictions. We build separate future and past topic indexes to capture prior and posterior media narratives about the housing market. 
We use the mixed-frequency machine learning approach to generate a sequence of nowcasts/forecasts of monthly
 housing prices based on a vast local newspapers corpus related to the housing market. 
 The predictions are based on linear models estimated via the LASSO and elastic net, nonlinear models based on artificial neural networks, 
 and ensembles of linear and nonlinear models. 
 The results indicate that news data contain valuable information about the housing market's direction.

  This paper assesses the role of past remittances in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 employment shocks on food security in Nigeria. 
           We quantify the mitigating effects relying on a difference-in-difference framework based on pre-and post-COVID-19 surveys. 
           The results indicate that previous remittances mitigate the negative consequences of the COVID-19 employment shock, especially in the short term. 
           We find that 100% of the deterioration in food insecurity owing to the shock is offset by the remittances received.
           While the adverse effects of the shock persist over time, this mitigation effect appears to exist only in the early stages of the pandemic. 
           Furthermore, the mitigation effect of remittances is heterogeneous in terms of the origin of remittances and recipients' area of residence and poverty status. 
           Remittances from abroad have a more substantial mitigating effect than domestic ones. We also find that remittances have a more pronounced mitigating impact in rural areas and non-poor households. 
           Finally, our results shed light on the capital channel as crucial in explaining the attenuating role of past remittances. 
           Our findings suggest that formal financial inclusion, the ownership of capital such as livestock, and rental earnings amplify the mitigating effect of remittances.

         <p align="justify">
           The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of lockdown on human mobility based on a sample of Africa countries. 
           Using a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach we find that lockdown causes a sharp decline in people's movement suggesting high compliance with social distancing requirements in countries under lockdown.
           Following the lockdown, workplace visits decrease by nearly 14 points of percentage in comparison to the baseline. 
           We observe a similar decline concerning the visits in retail and recreation places or groceries and pharmacies. 
           Inversely, the time spent at home increase by 6 points of percentage. 
           These findings suggest that compliance with social-distancing requirements is higher in countries applying strict containment measures.
           More interestingly, this paper provides evidence that people's compliance with social-distancing measures is higher when combining lockdown measures with economic and fiscal interventions. 
           We also find that access to the internet or increasing acquisition information about COVID-19 amplifies compliance with stay-at-home orders.
