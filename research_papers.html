         <p align="justify"> This paper examines the comovement among factors extracted from two distinct large panels (or groups) of variables.
    We show that estimating factors introduces a bias in the estimated correlation between factors,
    which disappears if the factors are estimated from panel data sets containing many cross-sectional series. 
    We show that a modified version of the wild bootstrap algorithm proposed by Gonçalves and Perron (2014) 
    can correct the bias and provide reliable inference on the correlation of interest. Additionally, we apply our modified wild 
    bootstrap method to analyze the influence of institutional factors on economic growth, as examined in Deniz et al. (2018), and the degree of
    synchronization of business cycles in developed and emerging economies, as explored in Kose et al. (2013) and 
    Aastveit et al. (2015).</p>

         <p align="justify">
           This paper evaluates the informational content of sentiment extracted from news articles about the state of the economy. 
           First, we apply deep learning and lexical-based techniques to construct a new high-frequency measure of sentiment indices embodied in a vast news corpus covering economic 
           and financial articles in Canada from January 1977 to March 2022. These sentiment indices are constructed at the sectoral (or 6-digit NAICS), provincial, and national levels. Second, we document that the sentiment indices significantly correlate with contemporaneous
           key economic and financial variables such as GDP, inflation, housing prices, and unemployment. 
           Third, we use an advanced machine learning method to isolate information about future, current, and past sentiments. 
           Finally, this paper provides novel evidence of how news sentiment tracks current and future economic and financial conditions and significantly 
           enhances predictive power in forecasting models using shrinkage methods and non-linear machine learning techniques.</p>

 <li> <b><a href="https://firminayivodji.github.io/research_papers/">How Media Narratives Influence Canadian Regional Housing Markets</a></b> </li> 
 <p align="justify"> Housing price prediction is a big challenge. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) showed that even the most sophisticated traditional
 macro-financial models failed to foresee the crisis. 
 In this paper, we investigate whether information from Canadian local newspaper articles about housing market narratives could improve
 local housing price predictions. We build separate future and past topic indexes to capture prior and posterior media narratives about the housing market. 
We use the mixed-frequency machine learning approach to generate a sequence of nowcasts/forecasts of monthly
 housing prices based on a vast local newspapers corpus related to the housing market. 
 The predictions are based on linear models estimated via the LASSO and elastic net, nonlinear models based on artificial neural networks, 
 and ensembles of linear and nonlinear models. 
 The results indicate that news data contain valuable information about the housing market's direction.

<li> <b>Food Security and COVID-19 Employment Shock in Nigeria: Any ex-ante Mitigating Effects of Past Remittances?</b>, with A., Akim and J., Kouton [<a href = "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3833558">SSRN</a>][<a href = https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/food-policy>Revise & resubmit, Food Policy</a>]</li>   
 <p align="justify"> This paper assesses the role of past remittances in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 employment shocks on food security in Nigeria.
   We build on the rich recent literature on the difference-in-difference method to propose an estimator of the mitigating effects parameter. 
   The identifying assumptions of the estimator are formally derived. Using pre-and post-COVID-19 surveys, our results suggest that past remittances can alleviate
   the negative consequences of COVID-19 employment shocks, particularly in the short term. However, the mitigation effect is limited to the early stages of 
   the pandemic, as the negative effects of the shock persist over time. Additionally, we find that the impact of remittances on mitigating the shock is varied 
   based on the origin of remittances, recipients’ area of residence, and poverty status. Furthermore, our study highlights the importance of the capital channel
   in explaining the mitigating role of past remittances. Our findings demonstrate that formal financial inclusion, capital ownership 
   such as livestock, and rental earnings increase the impact of remittances in mitigating the negative consequences of COVID-19 employment shocks on food security.

    <li> <b>High-Frequency Inflation Expectations from Big Data: A Natural Language Approach</b> </li> 
       <p align="justify"> In this study, we leverage advanced computational techniques, including textual analysis and machine learning, 
        on a comprehensive dataset of more than 2 million newspaper articles and 40 million tweets across Canadian provinces to build novel high-frequency and real-time indicators
        of consumer inflation expectations at both the national and subnational levels. 
        To achieve this, we first identify news articles and tweets related to inflation or prices, then construct daily measures
        of text-based inflation expectations which is the difference between the number of news articles or tweets about inflation and the number
        of tweets about deflation through a combination of state-of-the-art techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA),
        transformer text classification, and a dictionary-based approach. Our findings indicate a high correlation between the resulting 
        text-based inflation expectations indices and consumers’ survey-based inflation expectations and inflation rate. Subsequently, 
        we use a mixed-frequency machine learning approach to generate nowcasts/forecasts of quarterly inflation expectations based on large sets
        of text indicators and Google Trends search volume data for inflation-related terms. The predictions are based on linear models estimated 
        via the LASSO, Ridge, and Elastic net, nonlinear models based on Random Forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Artificial Neural Networks, 
        and ensembles of linear and nonlinear models. The results demonstrate that news and social media data contain valuable information
        regarding inflation dynamics, and our newly developed indicators effectively anticipate consumer expectations. 
        Moreover, we show that random forests and neural networks are very competitive models, and their superiority, 
        although stable across most of the time period considered. 
        The findings suggest that newspaper and social media data can serve as a timely source for eliciting beliefs on inflation.

   <li> <b>Deep Dynamic Factor Models in a Data‐Rich Environment</b> </li> 
  <!--  <p align="justify"> Autoencoders have become a popular nonlinear approach for dimension reduction in machine learning. 
    They offer an extension of the conventional principal component analysis to nonlinear spaces. 
    However, despite their widespread use, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding their theoretical properties. 
    This project aims to address this gap by establishing theoretical guarantees for the effective application of autoencoders in dimension reduction. 
    Additionally, it seeks to develop an asymptotic theory specifically tailored for a novel category of dynamic factor models within data-rich environments. 
    Furthermore, we can extend the existing literature on DSGE-DFM to encompass a new class of nonlinear factor models.-->

  <li> <b>Power Blackout ‘Pandemic' and Social Media Voice</b>, with J., Agossa</li>
<!-- <p align="justify"> The energy crisis in South Africa has become a major concern for governments, 
    businesses, and consumers. While conventional survey methods to gauge public opinion on power blackouts are costly and time-consuming,
    Twitter has emerged as a useful tool for collecting data on the crisis, providing a more efficient and cost-effective way to gauge public sentiment through tweets. 
    This study explores the use of Twitter to assess public sentiment on the energy crisis in South Africa, 
    analyzing all tweets related to the issue from January 2010 to February 2023. 
    By doing so, the study identified significant variations in sentiment across different cities and provinces,
    highlighting Twitter's value in understanding public sentiment and gaining insights into the issue. 
    Furthermore, the study used machine learning techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), 
    to identify key topics discussed in the data, which could inform policy decisions to address the country's energy crisis. 
    Additionally, the study found that the energy crisis has increased people's interest in renewable energy.
    Finally, the dynamic responses of macro variables to the identified energy crisis sentiment are consistent with the theoretical consensus. -->

         <p align="justify">   
  This paper assesses the role of past remittances in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 employment shocks on food security in Nigeria. 
           We quantify the mitigating effects relying on a difference-in-difference framework based on pre-and post-COVID-19 surveys. 
           The results indicate that previous remittances mitigate the negative consequences of the COVID-19 employment shock, especially in the short term. 
           We find that 100% of the deterioration in food insecurity owing to the shock is offset by the remittances received.
           While the adverse effects of the shock persist over time, this mitigation effect appears to exist only in the early stages of the pandemic. 
           Furthermore, the mitigation effect of remittances is heterogeneous in terms of the origin of remittances and recipients' area of residence and poverty status. 
           Remittances from abroad have a more substantial mitigating effect than domestic ones. We also find that remittances have a more pronounced mitigating impact in rural areas and non-poor households. 
           Finally, our results shed light on the capital channel as crucial in explaining the attenuating role of past remittances. 
           Our findings suggest that formal financial inclusion, the ownership of capital such as livestock, and rental earnings amplify the mitigating effect of remittances.

      <li> <b>Do Economic and Fiscal Relief Measures Amplify the Lockdown-Compliance Effect with Social Distancing in Africa?</b>, with A., Akim [<a href = "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3621693">SSRN</a>]</li> 
         <p align="justify">
           The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of lockdown on human mobility based on a sample of Africa countries. 
           Using a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach we find that lockdown causes a sharp decline in people's movement suggesting high compliance with social distancing requirements in countries under lockdown.
           Following the lockdown, workplace visits decrease by nearly 14 points of percentage in comparison to the baseline. 
           We observe a similar decline concerning the visits in retail and recreation places or groceries and pharmacies. 
           Inversely, the time spent at home increase by 6 points of percentage. 
           These findings suggest that compliance with social-distancing requirements is higher in countries applying strict containment measures.
           More interestingly, this paper provides evidence that people's compliance with social-distancing measures is higher when combining lockdown measures with economic and fiscal interventions. 
           We also find that access to the internet or increasing acquisition information about COVID-19 amplifies compliance with stay-at-home orders.
