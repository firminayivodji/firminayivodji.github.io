  <li> <b>Identification and Estimation of Common Factors in Panel Data</b> </li> 
         <p align="justify">This paper examines the estimation of relations among factors extracted from different panel data sets. Two interesting applications are the factors contributing to economic growth and the synchronicity of business cycles. 
           We show that the estimation of factors induces a bias in the estimated correlation between factors which disappears if the factors are estimated from panel data sets that contain a large number of cross-sectional series. 
           We show that a modified version of the wild bootstrap algorithm proposed by Gonçalves and Perron (2014) can correct the bias and provide reliable inference on the correlation of interest. Finally, we apply our modified bootstrap method 
           to the contributions of institutional factors to economic growth analyzed in Deniz et al. (2018) and to the degree of synchronization of business cycles in developed countries and emerging economies in Kose et al. (2013) and Aastveit et al. (2015).</p>

        <li> <b>Measuring Economic Activity using News-Based Sentiment Indices</b> </li> 
         <p align="justify">This paper evaluates the informational content of sentiment extracted from news articles about the state of the economy. 
           First, I apply state-of-the-art deep learning and lexical-based techniques to construct a new high-frequency measure of sentiment indices embodied in a vast news corpus covering economic 
           and financial articles in Canada from January 1977 to June 2019. These sentiment indices are constructed both at the provincial and national levels. Second, I document that the sentiment indices significantly correlate with contemporaneous
           key economic and financial variables such as inflation and unemployment. Third, this paper provides novel evidence of how news sentiment tracks current economic and financial conditions and significantly enhances predictive power in existing forecasting models.

      <li> <b>Do Economic and Fiscal Relief Measures Amplify the Lockdown-Compliance Effect with Social Distancing in Africa?</b>, with Almouksit Akim </li> 
         <p align="justify">
          The objective of this paper is to assess the impact of lockdown on human mobility based on a sample of Africa countries. Using a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach 
           we find that lockdown causes a sharp decline in people's movement suggesting high compliance with social distancing requirements in countries under lockdown. 
           Following the lockdown, workplace visits decrease by nearly 14 points of percentage in comparison to the baseline. We observe a similar decline concerning the visits in retail and recreation places or groceries and pharmacies.
           Inversely, the time spent at home increase by 6 points of percentage. These findings suggest that compliance with social-distancing requirements is higher in countries applying strict containment measures. 
           More interestingly, this paper provides evidence that people's compliance with social-distancing measures is higher when combining lockdown measures with economic and fiscal interventions.
           We also find that access to the internet or increasing acquisition information about COVID-19 amplifies compliance with stay-at-home orders.

    <li> <b>Do Remittances Mitigate COVID-19 Employment Shock on Food Security? Evidence from Nigeria</b>, with Almouksit Akim and Jeffrey Kouton [<a href = https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3833558>Paper</a>]</li>
    <p><em>forthcoming.</em></p>
         <p align="justify">This paper assesses the mitigating role of remittances amidst adverse COVID-19 employment shock on food insecurity in Nigeria. 
           We use a difference-in-difference approach based on pre- and post-COVID-19 surveys while controlling for time and household fixed effects.
           The results indicate that remittances mitigate the negative consequences of COVID-19 employment shock, especially in the short term. 
           We find that 100% of the deterioration in food insecurity owing to the shock is offset by the remittances received. 
           While the adverse effects of the shock persist over time, this mitigation effect appears to exist only in the early stages of the pandemic. 
           Furthermore, the mitigation effect of remittances is heterogeneous in terms of the origin of remittances and recipients' area of residence and poverty status.
           Remittances from abroad have a stronger mitigating effect than domestic ones do. We also find remittances have a more pronounced mitigating effect in rural areas
           and for non-poor households. Finally, our results shed light on the capital channel as a crucial mechanism explaining the attenuating role of remittances. 
           Our findings suggest that formal financial inclusion, the ownership of capital like livestock, and rental earnings amplify the mitigating effect of remittances.

    <li> <b>Fiscal Vulnerabilities and  the Role of Fiscal Policy  in Commodity-Exporting Countries </b>, with Christine Richaud, Sebastian Essl, Arthur Mendes and Samer Matta [<a href =https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/32180?locale-attribute=fr>Paper</a>] </li>
    <p><em>World Bank, MTI discussion paper</em>, 2019.</p>
             <p align="justify">The paper updates the analysis of the fiscal policy response over the recent commodity cycle, contributes to the analysis of key drivers of fiscal policy procyclicality, and provides a stock-tacking of current fiscal vulnerabilities.
               Countercyclical fiscal policy during good times has been a key factor affecting the ability of commodity exporters to sustainably support economic activity when prices started declining. 
               Fiscal space to withstand the next shock has narrowed in many emerging and developing economies (EMDEs) and may also be constrained by contingent liabilities stemming from exposure of state-owned enterprises and public and systemic banks to the commodity-sector. 
               Fiscal consolidation is still necessary in many commodity-exporting EMDEs to reduce debt risks, rebuild fiscal and external buffers, and facilitate access to affordable financing. 
               Fiscal policy should particularly aim at reducing the high volatility of public investment spending in commodity-exporting countries, both in good and bad times.</p>
