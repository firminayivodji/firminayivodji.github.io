  <li> <b>Identification and Estimation of Common Factors in Panel Data</b> </li> 
         <p align="justify">This paper examines the estimation of relations among factors extracted from different panel data sets. Two interesting applications are the factors contributing to economic growth and the synchronicity of business cycles. 
           We show that the estimation of factors induces a bias in the estimated correlation between factors which disappears if the factors are estimated from panel data sets that contain a large number of cross-sectional series. 
           We show that a modified version of the wild bootstrap algorithm proposed by <a href = https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304407614000748>Gonçalves and Perron (2014)</a> can correct the bias and provide reliable inference on the correlation of interest. Finally, we apply our modified bootstrap method 
           to the contributions of institutional factors to economic growth analyzed in Deniz et al. (2018) and to the degree of synchronization of business cycles in developed countries and emerging economies in Kose et al. (2013) and Aastveit et al. (2015).</p>

        <li> <b>Measuring Economic Activity using News-Based Sentiment Indices</b> </li> 
         <p align="justify">
           This paper evaluates the informational content of sentiment extracted from news articles about the state of the economy. 
           First, I apply state-of-the-art deep learning and lexical-based techniques to construct a new high-frequency measure of sentiment indices embodied in a vast news corpus covering economic 
           and financial articles in Canada from January 1977 to March 2022. These sentiment indices are constructed both at the provincial and national levels. Second, I document that the sentiment indices significantly correlate with contemporaneous
           key economic and financial variables such as GDP, inflation, housing prices, and unemployment. 
           Third, this paper provides novel evidence of how news sentiment tracks current economic and financial conditions and significantly enhances predictive power in existing forecasting models.  </p>

        <li> <b>Food security and COVID-19 employment shock in Nigeria: Any ex-ante mitigating effects of past remittances?</b>, with A., Akim and J., Kouton [<a href = https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3833558>SSRN</a>][<a href = https://cepr.org/publications/covid-economics-issue-78>Covid Economics - Issue 78</a>]</li>
         <p align="justify">
           This paper assesses the mitigating role of remittances amidst adverse COVID-19 employment shock on food insecurity in Nigeria. 
           We use a difference-in-difference approach based on pre- and post-COVID-19 surveys while controlling for time and household fixed effects.
           The results indicate that remittances mitigate the negative consequences of COVID-19 employment shock, especially in the short term. 
           We find that 100% of the deterioration in food insecurity owing to the shock is offset by the remittances received. 
           While the adverse effects of the shock persist over time, this mitigation effect appears to exist only in the early stages of the pandemic. 
           Furthermore, the mitigation effect of remittances is heterogeneous in terms of the origin of remittances and recipients' area of residence and poverty status.
           Remittances from abroad have a stronger mitigating effect than domestic ones do. We also find remittances have a more pronounced mitigating effect in rural areas
           and for non-poor households. Finally, our results shed light on the capital channel as a crucial mechanism explaining the attenuating role of remittances. 
           Our findings suggest that formal financial inclusion, the ownership of capital like livestock, and rental earnings amplify the mitigating effect of remittances.

      <li> <b>Do Economic and Fiscal Relief Measures Amplify the Lockdown-Compliance Effect with Social Distancing in Africa?</b>, with A., Akim [<a href = https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3833558>SSRN</a>]</li> 
         <p align="justify">
          This paper assesses the role of past remittances in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 employment shocks on food security in Nigeria. 
           We quantify the mitigating effects relying on a difference-in-difference framework based on pre-and post-COVID-19 surveys. 
           The results indicate that previous remittances mitigate the negative consequences of the COVID-19 employment shock, especially in the short term. 
           We find that 100% of the deterioration in food insecurity owing to the shock is offset by the remittances received.
           While the adverse effects of the shock persist over time, this mitigation effect appears to exist only in the early stages of the pandemic. 
           Furthermore, the mitigation effect of remittances is heterogeneous in terms of the origin of remittances and recipients' area of residence and poverty status. 
           Remittances from abroad have a more substantial mitigating effect than domestic ones. We also find that remittances have a more pronounced mitigating impact in rural areas and non-poor households. 
           Finally, our results shed light on the capital channel as crucial in explaining the attenuating role of past remittances. 
           Our findings suggest that formal financial inclusion, the ownership of capital such as livestock, and rental earnings amplify the mitigating effect of remittances.  </p>
