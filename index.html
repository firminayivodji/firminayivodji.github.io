Welcome to my website!  I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the <a href=https://sceco.umontreal.ca/english/home/">University of Montreal</a>. 
   </p>
   <br>
    <p>
   My research interests include   <span style="color:rgb(16, 141, 193)">Econometrics, Big Data Techniques, Causal Inference, Machine Learning/Textual Analysis, Household Finance and Climate Finance</span>.
    </p>

    <br>
  <p>
My research focuses on factor analysis in high-dimensional datasets and large panel models with interactive fixed effects. I am also interested in applying Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to answer macro-finance, and climate finance questions. My teaching interests are quantitative methods for economics and business, machine learning, climate finance, and open-source programming (i.e., R/Python).  
 </p>

  <p>
During the summer of 2021, I joined the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Home">International Monetary Fund</a> as a Ph.D. intern in the Fund Internship Program (FIP). I was an Economist consultant at the Observatory of the Economic Francophonie during the fall of 2020. I also previously worked as an Economist in the IMF’s Senegal Country Desk and the Macroeconomics Trade Investment (MTI) of the <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/en/home">World Bank</a>. 
  </p> 
  
  <br>
  <p>
  Prior to this, I hold a master’s degree in Statistics and Economics from ENSAE.
