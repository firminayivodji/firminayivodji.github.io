<p> June 2021: I was recently awarded the Yiran Fan Memorial Prize, generously established by Lars Hansen and Grace Tsiang in memory of Yiran Fan and his contributions to the Chicago Booth community. <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/why-booth/stories/in-memoriam-phd-student-yiran-fan">Please take a moment</a> to commemorate Yiran's kind and generous spirit and his devotion to bringing fellow students, young researchers, and faculty as companions in learning.

    <p>I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Université de Montréal. My primary areas of research are Econometrics, Macroeconomics, Machine Learning, Climate Finance, and Macro-Financial Issues.
I'm especially interested in large-dimensional factor models and estimation/testing under cross-section dependence. I am also interested in applying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques for Labor Market, Housing Markets, Monetary Policy and Empirical Financial studies. I expect to graduate in August 2021.</p>
