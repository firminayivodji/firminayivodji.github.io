   <p>I'm especially interested in large-dimensional factor models and estimation/testing under cross-section dependence. I am also interested in applying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques for Labor Market, Housing Markets, Monetary Policy and Empirical Financial studies. I expect to graduate in August 2021.</p>
