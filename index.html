During the summer of 2021, I joined the International Monetary Fund as a Ph.D. intern in the Fund Internship Program (FIP). I was an Economist consultant at the Observatory of the Economic Francophonie during the fall of 2020. I also previously worked as an Economist in the IMF’s Senegal Country Desk and the Macroeconomics Trade Investment (MTI) of the World Bank on debt sustainability, IMF program issues, financial sector conditionalities, fiscal and monetary policies, commodities prices, WAEMU, and private credit. I hold a Master’s degree in Statistics and Economics from the ENSAE and a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics and Economics from the ENEAM.
