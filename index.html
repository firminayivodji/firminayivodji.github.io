 I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the Université de Montréal. My primary areas of research are Econometrics, Macroeconomics, Machine Learning, Climate Finance, and Macro-Financial Issues.
I'm especially interested in large-dimensional factor models and estimation/testing under cross-section dependence. I am also interested in applying Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques for Labor Market, Housing Markets, Monetary Policy and Empirical Financial studies. I expect to graduate in August 2021.
