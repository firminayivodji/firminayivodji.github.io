Before starting my PhD, I worked several years for the thinktank adelphi, designing, coordinating, and contributing to research and consultancy projects on a variety of environmental topics.
Having a multidisciplinary background I aim to build bridges between the natural and social sciences. I am also a passionate teacher of economics and environmental sciences. I have been designing and teaching courses on environmental economics, development and trade, sustainable development, and environmental change.
