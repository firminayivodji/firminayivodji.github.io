    <h2>Levels vs. Changes</h2>
   May 2021<br><br>
    In many empirical models within finance, one needs to decide whether to use variables as their levels or their changes. In this post, I briefly go over reasons why one may chooses one versus the other.<br>

    <h2>Variations in SVARs</h2>
   January 2021<br><br>
    In this post, I explore the variations in Structural VARs (SVARs) and their recent applications. This is mostly an amalgam of notes based on my readings of multiple lecture notes, papers, and documentations.<br>

    <h2>Programming in Stata vs. Python</h2>
   December 2020<br><br>
    Recently, I've spent some time implementing a particular task in both Stata and in Python. Despite this <a href="http://www.danielmsullivan.com/pages/tutorial_stata_to_python.html">very useful reference</a>, I've had a lot of struggle getting the output in both platforms exactly identical. Here is a list of things to watch out for when you're puzzled by why the two sets of code yield different output.<br>

    <h2>Expectation Extraction</h2>
   September 2020<br><br>
    Asset prices and portfolio holdings encode information about investor beliefs about the future and about investors' concerns for risk. A natural empirical exercise is to use the financial market data to extract such information. In this post, I briefly outline a few approaches that have emerged recently.<br>

   <h2>Khwaja-Mian (2008) Estimator</h2>
   July 2020<br><br>
   In this post, I explain the Khwaja-Mian (2008) estimator, which is a technique used to control for credit demand shocks in order to identify credit supply shocks i.e. the "bank lending channel." Authors introduce time-variant firm fixed effects to fully capture the demand for credit by focusing on firms with multiple banking relationships. They actually do more than this, but subsequent papers citing this paper only refer to the inclusion of fixed effects.<br>
