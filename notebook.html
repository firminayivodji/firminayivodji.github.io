<h2>Measuring Economic Activity using News-Based Sentiment Indices</h2>
<p align="justify">This paper evaluates the informational content of sentiment extracted from news articles about the state of the economy. First, I apply state-of-the-art deep learning and lexical-based techniques to construct a new high-frequency measure of sentiment indices embodied in a vast news corpus covering economic and financial articles in Canada from January 1977 to March 2022. These sentiment indices are constructed both at the provincial and national levels. Second, I document that the sentiment indices significantly correlate with contemporaneous key economic and financial variables such as GDP, inflation, housing prices, and unemployment. Third, this paper provides novel evidence of how news sentiment tracks current economic and financial conditions and significantly enhances predictive power in existing forecasting models.</p>
